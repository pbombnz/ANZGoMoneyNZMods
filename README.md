This is a Xposed module allows users to bypass root detection and enable device spoofing tactics on all your favourite Kiwi applications such as ANZ GoMoney NZ, Semble, TVNZ OnDemand and newly added 3NOW. This module allows you to take advantage of Wallet features or streaming from rooted or non-supported devices. 

For more general information about the module please visit the [XDA thread link](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xposed-anz-gomoney-zealand-mods-bypass-t3270623).

## Developer Notice
The source code is very rushed and poorly designed, especially due to constant updating and fast addition of new features over the last few weeks. In the future, I plan to apply actual software design standards, make the source code easier to read and understand, clean up commenting and reduce duplicated code. All this will be done when I have time though, possibly in the university breaks and holiday periods.
